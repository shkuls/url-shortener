# url-shortener
This is a URL shortener I have created as a part of my project with ACM IITR. This web application can be used to shorten URLs and also store as well as search notes associated with them. The user can also view previously generated URLs.

How to setup this project locally?
  use npm install command to install all the dependencies

  Setup .env in the parent folder which will contain an environmental variable MONGO_URI which stores the connection string for MongoDB
  
Internal working
  This is a basic URL shortener which can take a long URL as an input and convert it to a short URL.
  The user can also add notes associated with each URL.
  All the previouly generated URL can be viewed.
  The user can also search a URL previously generated using its note or the URL itself.
